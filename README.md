# MoonMakerProtocolToken
Moon Maker Protocol (a so-called “MMP”) is a DeFi launch pad project, which assist a novel DeFi token launching their product to the community.

**“We bring BSC launch pad to the decentralised world”**

### What makes MMP unique?

Currently, a variety of new Defi project has been created on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), with the assistance of BINANCE LAUNCH PAD project . This shade more light on the as created project and launched token, bringing the trust from the Crytoholic (Crypto investor). It is obvious that the “Centralised Launch Pad” is an superb successful Crypto-incubator platform; however, there are so many limitation to participate in this CZ launch pad program e.g., project size, direction, especially initial funding investment. This is such a limit for the development of the DeFi project, which may limit a significant growth in the DeFi.
